# Tutorial - Before you start

Make sure you have followed the Granitic installation instructions at:

https://github.com/graniticio/granitic/doc/installation.md 

These tutorials are designed to be followed in sequence - each tutorial builds upon the last one. If you want to skip
one or more tutorials, you will find working source code for each tutorial at:
 
https://github.com/graniticio/granitic-examples/tutorial
 
The instructions for the tutorials assume that you are happy to create projects under

<pre>
$GOPATH/src/grnc-tutorial
</pre>

You should create that directory before you begin the first tutorial. 

If you are using an IDE, it's recommended that you create a project in the $GOPATH/src/grnc-tutorial folder. That way 
you'll be able to see the source for all of the tutorials you've worked on in a single project.
